To run manually from the pi, displaying windows on your laptop:

* Make sure you have a working X Server on your computer (use XMing on Windows)

* SSH into the pi (with X forwarding enabled in PuTTY)

* Stop the running vision process `sudo systemctl stop vision`

* Run the vision on the pi, and within a few seconds it should pop up ('cd vision && ./start.sh')
