THIS MAY NOT WORK / IS UNTESTED, FOR NOW DEPLOY TO RESTART

To use on a new pi, drop these files (ending with .service and .path) in /etc/systemd/system/

Then, enable them with `sudo systemctl enable vision.service && sudo systemctl enable vision-watcher.path`

Finally, to start the whole thing (this will happen automatically after a reboot), do `sudo systemctl start vision.service && sudo systemctl start vision-watcher.path`

From then on, for every deploy the vision code will restart.
